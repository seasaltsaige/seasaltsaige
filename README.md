## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My names Max, and currently I'm still a student, getting my Associates in CS. I have a passion for web development, even if I struggle with design and user experience some times. I love to learn and I'll only get better with practice. Check out my pinned projects :)

While I've used Github for many years to host my projects, I'm only really now starting to delve into fully utilizing it for my projects.
