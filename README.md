## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My names Saige, and currently I'm still a student, getting my Bachelors in CPE at California Polytechnic San Luis Obispo. I have a passion for web development, even if I struggle with design and user experience some times. Recently been getting incredibly into Embedded development, both hardware and software. Still learning and moving on from the Arduino IDE, but soon to dive into the ESP-IDF and the nRF Connect SDK. I love to learn and I'll only get better with practice. 

### Check out my pinned projects :)
